      "Mohammed Aamir Hussain Khan (pronounced ; born 14 March 1965), widely known as Aamir Khan, is an Indian actor, director, filmmaker and television talk-show host.\n",
      "Through his career spanning over thirty years in Hindi films, Khan has established himself as one of the most popular and influential actors of Indian cinema.\n",
      " Khan is the recipient of numerous awards, including nine Filmfare Awards, four National Film Awards, and an AACTA Award, as well as an Academy Award nomination.\n",
      "Khan first appeared on screen as a child actor in his uncle Nasir Hussain's film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973).\n",
      "In 1999 he founded Aamir Khan Productions, whose first film, Lagaan (2001), was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and earned him a National Film Award for Best Popular Film and two more Filmfare Awards (Best Actor and Best Film).\n",
      "After a four-year absence from the screen, Khan returned to portray leading roles, notably in the 2006 box-office hits Fanaa and Rang De Basanti.\n",
      "Khan's greatest global success came with the thriller Ghajini (2008), the comedy-drama 3 Idiots (2009), the action film Dhoom 3 (2013), the satire PK (2014), and the sports biopic Dangal (2016), each having held the record for being the highest-grossing Indian film, while Secret Superstar (2017) held the record for being highest-grossing Indian film featuring a female protagonist.\n",
      " Khan won his third Best Actor award at Filmfare for Dangal.\n",
      "Within and beyond the film industry, Khan is an activist and humanitarian, and has participated and spoken out for various social causes, some of which have sparked political controversy.\n",
      " Khan was married to his first wife, Reena Dutta, for fifteen years, after which he married the film director Kiran Rao.\n",
      "Khan was born on 14 March 1965 in Bombay to Tahir Hussain, a film producer, and Zeenat Hussain.\n",
      "  Khan is the eldest of four siblings; he has a brother, the actor Faisal Khan, and two sisters, Farhat and Nikhat Khan (married to Santosh Hegde).\n",
      " His nephew, Imran Khan, is a contemporary Hindi film actor.\n",
      "As a child actor, Khan appeared on screen in two minor roles.\n",
      " Khan attended J.B. Petit School for his pre-primary education, later switching to St. Anne's High School, Bandra until the eighth grade, and completed his ninth and tenth grade at the Bombay Scottish School, Mahim.\n",
      " Khan described his childhood as \"tough\" due to the financial problems faced by his father, whose film productions were mostly unsuccessful.\n",
      "At the age of sixteen, Khan was involved in the experimental process of making a 40-minute silent film, Paranoia, which was directed by his school friend Aditya Bhattacharya.\n",
      " Khan's parents did not want him to make films, wishing that he would instead pursue a \"steady\" career as an engineer or doctor.\n",
      "Khan subsequently joined a theatre group called Avantar, where he performed backstage activities for over a year.\n",
      " After completing high school, Khan decided to discontinue studying, choosing instead to work as an assistant director to Nasir Hussain on the Hindi films Manzil Manzil (1984) and Zabardast (1985).\n",
      "In addition to assisting Hussain, Khan acted in documentaries directed by the students of FTII, Pune.\n",
      " The director Ketan Mehta noticed Khan in those films, and he offered him a role in the low-budget experimental film Holi (1984).\n",
      " Khan's role was that of a rowdy college student, an \"insignificant\" role that was described by CNN-IBN as \"lack in finesse\".\n",
      " The film was a tale of unrequited love and parental opposition, with Khan portraying Raj, a \"clean-cut, wholesome boy-next-door\".\n",
      " Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak proved to be a major commercial success, catapulting both Khan and Chawla to stardom.\n",
      " It received seven Filmfare Awards including a Best Male Debut trophy for Khan.\n",
      " Khan was awarded a National Film Award – Special Jury Award / Special Mention for his performances in both Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Raakh.\n",
      "Khan had five film releases in 1990.\n",
      "Khan appeared in several other films in the early 1990s, including Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992), Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993) (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and Rangeela (1995).\n",
      " Other successes include Andaz Apna Apna, a comedy film co-starring Salman Khan.\n",
      "In 1993, Khan also appeared in Yash Chopra's Parampara.\n",
      "Despite having an ensemble cast which also included Sunil Dutt, Vinod Khanna, Raveena Tandon and Saif Ali Khan, the film failed to find a wide audience and became a critical and commercial failure.\n",
      " Khan was also due to appear in Time Machine, a science-fiction film also starring Rekha, Raveena Tandon, Naseeruddin Shah and Amrish Puri.\n",
      "Khan continued to act in just one or two films a year, then an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor.\n",
      " Khan's career seemed to hit a plateau at this point of time, and most of the films to follow for the next few years were only partially successful.\n",
      "The following year, Khan appeared in the moderately successful Ghulam, for which he also did playback singing.\n",
      "John Mathew Matthan's Sarfarosh, Khan's first release in 1999, was also moderately successful, gaining an above average box office verdict.\n",
      " The film and Khan's role in it were highly appreciated by movie critics, as was his role in Deepa Mehta's Canadian-Indian art house film Earth (1998).\n",
      " Set during the 1947 partition of India, Earth was internationally acclaimed, by critics such as Roger Ebert, with Khan's negative portrayal of Dil Nawaz (\"Ice Candy Man\") considered his best performance up until then.\n",
      " His first release for the new millennium, Mela, in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, was both a box office and critical bomb.\n",
      "Khan also won his second Filmare Award for Best Actor.\n",
      "The success of Lagaan was followed by Dil Chahta Hai later that year, in which Khan co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna, with Preity Zinta playing his love interest.\n",
      " Khan then took a four-year break from Bollywood after divorce from his wife Reena Dutta.\n",
      "Khan made a comeback in 2005 with Ketan Mehta's Mangal Pandey: The Rising playing the title role of the real-life sepoy and martyr who helped spark the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n",
      "Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's award-winning Rang De Basanti was Khan's first release in 2006.\n",
      "In his next movie, Fanaa (2006), Khan co-starred with Kajol.\n",
      " The film, which was the second offering from Aamir Khan Productions, starred Khan in a supporting role as a teacher who befriends and helps a dyslexic child.\n",
      "Khan's performance was well-received, although he was particularly applauded for his directing.\n",
      " Khan received the Filmfare Awards for Best Director and Best Film of 2007, as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.\n",
      "In 2008, Khan appeared in the movie Ghajini.\n",
      "For his performance in the film, Khan received several Best Actor nominations at various award ceremonies as well as his fifteenth Filmfare Best Actor nomination.\n",
      "In 2009, Khan appeared in the commercially and critically acclaimed film 3 Idiots as Ranchodas Chanchad.\n",
      "3 Idiots became the highest-grossing Bollywood film ever at the time, breaking the previous record set by Ghajini, which also starred Khan.\n",
      "Khan has been credited with opening up the Chinese markets for Indian films.\n",
      "His father Tahir Hussain previously had success in China with Caravan (1971), but Indian films declined in the country afterwards, before Aamir Khan opened up the Chinese market for Indian films in the early 21st century.\n",
      "Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result.\n",
      " By 2013, China grew to become the world's second largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, with Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014) and especially Dangal (2016).\n",
      "It was reported that Khan had disagreements with director Reema Kagti over the issue of his 2012 film Talaash, causing significant delays in the film's release.\n",
      " However, Khan said that the claims were baseless.\n",
      "Khan's next venture was Dhoom 3 with Yash Raj Films.\n",
      "In 2014, Khan appeared as the eponymous alien in Rajkumar Hirani's comedy-drama PK.\n",
      " The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time (the fourth time Khan achieved this feat).\n",
      " Khan's performance was unanimously praised by critics including Tamil leading actor Vijay was impressed by Aamir's perfection and dedication and reportedly enjoyed the film with his family on Christmas Eve.\n",
      " Raja Sen called the film a \"triumph\" and said: \"Aamir Khan is exceptional in PK, creating an irresistibly goofy character and playing him with absolute conviction.\n",
      "Khan produced and starred in Dangal (2016), directed by Nitesh Tiwari, with Khan portraying wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat.\n",
      " The film received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time domestically, surpassing PK, making it the fifth time Khan had achieved this feat.\n",
      " Worldwide, it became the fifth highest-grossing non-English language film of all time, earning Khan one of the highest salaries for a non-Hollywood actor, at $42 million.\n",
      "According to Hong Kong filmmaker Stanley Tong, Khan was initially offered a major role in the Jackie Chan blockbuster Kung Fu Yoga (2017).\n",
      "However, Khan could not take up the offer due to scheduling conflicts, as he was busy shooting for Dangal.\n",
      "In October 2017, Khan starred in a supporting role in his production Secret Superstar, with his Dangal co-star Zaira Wasim playing the lead role.\n",
      " Shaikh also appeared in Dangal while Kaif appeared alongside Khan in Dhoom 3.\n",
      "In March 2019, on his 54th birthday, Khan confirmed that he will next be seen in Lal Singh Chadda, an adaptation of the 1994 Hollywood classic, Forrest Gump.\n",
      "The film will feature Khan in the lead and will be directed by Advait Chandan, who previously directed Khan in Secret Superstar.\n",
      "Khan co-wrote the screenplay and script for the 1993 hit romantic comedy film Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke, where he also starred in the lead role.\n",
      " Khan began working as a producer after he set up his own production company, Aamir Khan Productions, in 1999.\n",
      "Its first film was Lagaan, which was released in 2001, starring Khan as the lead actor.\n",
      "Lagaan won numerous awards at several Indian award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA, and won the National Film Award for Most Popular Film, an award shared between Khan and the film's director, Ashutosh Gowariker.\n",
      " For producing the documentary Madness in the Desert on the making of Lagaan, Khan and director Satyajit Bhatkal were awarded the National Film Award for Best Exploration/Adventure Film at the 51st National Film Awards ceremony.\n",
      " Khan wrote the climax of Rang De Basanti (2006), which he starred in.\n",
      "Khan also played a supporting role in the film, sharing the screen with new child actor Darsheel Safary.\n",
      "Khan's work also won him the Best Director.\n",
      "In 2008, Khan launched his nephew Imran Khan's debut in the film Jaane Tu...\n",
